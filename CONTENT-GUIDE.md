## Voice & Tone Reference

Think of the site as:
- ✅ A colleague sharing useful work
- ✅ A researcher presenting findings
- ✅ A professional offering tools

NOT as:
- ❌ A teacher instructing students
- ❌ A salesperson making a pitch
- ❌ A guru revealing secrets
- ❌ A motivational speaker inspiring action

## When Unsure

Ask yourself:
1. "Would I say this to a colleague in a professional setting?"
2. "Am I explaining what exists, or telling them what to do?"
3. "Is this information, or is it persuasion in an invasive way?"

If unsure, err on the side of understating rather than overstating.
