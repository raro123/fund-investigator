# Content Editing Guide

## Maintaining the "Knowledgeable Colleague" Tone

This guide ensures all content updates preserve Fund Investigator's distinctive voice.

## Core Principles

### 1. Informative, Not Instructional
**What this means:** Explain what's available, not why someone should learn it.

❌ **Avoid:**
"Learn how to properly analyze mutual funds! Understand the importance of risk-adjusted returns."

✅ **Use:**
"The analysis covers risk-adjusted performance through Sharpe and Sortino ratios."

### 2. Helpful, Not Pushy
**What this means:** Provide options and information, don't push or create urgency.

❌ **Avoid:**
"Get instant access now! Don't miss this opportunity! Join thousands of investors!"

✅ **Use:**
"Questions or feedback? Feel free to reach out."

### 3. Matter-of-Fact, Not Sales-y
**What this means:** State capabilities clearly without hype.

❌ **Avoid:**
"Revolutionary free tool! Professional-grade analysis at your fingertips!"

✅ **Use:**
"Analyze any AMFI-registered fund with detailed performance and risk metrics."

## Writing Style Rules

### Use These Formats
- **Complete sentences and paragraphs** (primary format)
- **Natural prose** for explanations
- **Line length:** Max 65 characters for readability
- **Line height:** 1.7 for body text

### Avoid These Formats
- ❌ Bullet points for general content (use prose instead)
- ❌ Excessive bolding or emphasis
- ❌ Headers for every paragraph
- ❌ Numbered lists (except for step-by-step instructions)

### Language Guidelines

**Exclamation Marks:**
- Maximum 1 per page
- Preferably zero
- Exception: Genuine excitement about specific features

**Superlatives:**
- Avoid: "best", "ultimate", "revolutionary", "amazing", "incredible"
- Use: Specific, measurable descriptions instead

**Questions:**
- Use sparingly
- When used, make them genuine and thoughtful
- Avoid rhetorical marketing questions

**Verbs:**
- Prefer: "provides", "includes", "covers", "shows"
- Avoid: "unlocks", "empowers", "transforms", "revolutionizes"

## Section-Specific Guidelines

### Hero Section
- State the main value proposition clearly
- No hype or urgency
- Single, clear CTA
- Brief supporting points (not benefits list)

**Template:**
```
H1: [What the platform is]
Subheading: [What it provides, how it helps]
CTA: [Simple action]
Supporting: [3 factual points]
```

### Feature Descriptions
Focus on WHAT is included, not WHY it's valuable.

❌ "Sharpe ratios help you understand risk-adjusted returns!"
✅ "Risk-adjusted returns through Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios"

### Problem Statements
Present problems matter-of-factly without drama.

❌ "Most investors are making terrible decisions without proper analysis!"
✅ "Making informed decisions requires more than looking at past returns."

### About Section
Professional and straightforward.

❌ "I'm passionate about democratizing financial analysis!"
✅ "Fund Investigator is maintained by [name], with a background in data analysis."

### Call-to-Actions
Frame as options, not imperatives.

❌ "Start Analyzing Now!" → "Get Your Free Report!"
✅ "Analyze a fund" → "Read reports" → "Get in touch"

## Common Patterns

### When Explaining Features

**Pattern:** What it does + What it includes
```
[Feature name] provides [capability]. The analysis covers [specific items], 
along with [additional items] to [purpose].
```

**Example:**
"The analysis tool provides detailed fund metrics. The analysis covers 
risk-adjusted returns through Sharpe and Sortino ratios, along with 
drawdown patterns to understand downside behavior."

### When Describing Benefits

**Don't say:** "This will help you make better decisions!"
**Do say:** "Provides context to support your evaluation"

**Don't say:** "Understand your investments like a professional!"
**Do say:** "Standard metrics used in institutional analysis"

### When Inviting Contact

**Don't say:** "We'd love to hear from you! Get in touch today!"
**Do say:** "Questions or feedback? Feel free to reach out."

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Feature Description

**Before (Too Teacher-like):**
"Learn how to analyze mutual funds the right way! Master Sharpe ratios, 
understand drawdowns, and become a savvy investor. Our comprehensive 
educational approach will transform how you invest!"

**After (Knowledgeable Colleague):**
"The analysis covers risk-adjusted performance through Sharpe and Sortino 
ratios, along with drawdown patterns to understand downside behavior. 
Rolling returns across multiple timeframes reveal consistency."

### Example 2: Problem Statement

**Before (Too Alarmist):**
"Are you making blind investment decisions? Without proper analysis, 
you're risking your hard-earned money! Don't be another victim of 
poor fund selection!"

**After (Matter-of-fact):**
"Making informed mutual fund decisions requires more than looking at 
past returns. Understanding risk-adjusted performance, drawdown behavior, 
and consistency across market cycles provides crucial context."

### Example 3: About Section

**Before (Too Personal/Promotional):**
"Hi! I'm Ishpreet, and I'm passionate about helping everyday investors 
make smarter decisions. After years in finance, I built this amazing 
platform to share my knowledge with you!"

**After (Professional Peer):**
"Fund Investigator is maintained by Ishpreet Singh Modi, with a background 
in data analysis and statistics. The goal is to make thorough fund analysis 
accessible to individual investors."

## Checklist for New Content

Before publishing any new content, verify:

- [ ] No exclamation marks (or max 1 on entire page)
- [ ] No superlatives ("best", "ultimate", etc.)
- [ ] No urgency tactics ("now", "don't miss", "limited")
- [ ] No second-person imperatives ("you must", "you should")
- [ ] Uses complete sentences in paragraphs (not bullet lists)
- [ ] Explains WHAT, not WHY people should care
- [ ] Treats reader as intelligent and capable
- [ ] Maintains professional, helpful tone
- [ ] Provides information without pushing

## Voice & Tone Reference

Think of the site as:
- ✅ A colleague sharing useful work
- ✅ A researcher presenting findings
- ✅ A professional offering tools

NOT as:
- ❌ A teacher instructing students
- ❌ A salesperson making a pitch
- ❌ A guru revealing secrets
- ❌ A motivational speaker inspiring action

## When Unsure

Ask yourself:
1. "Would I say this to a colleague in a professional setting?"
2. "Am I explaining what exists, or telling them what to do?"
3. "Is this information, or is it persuasion?"

If unsure, err on the side of understating rather than overstating.

**Remember:** The goal is to be helpful and informative, like a knowledgeable 
peer who has done the analysis and is making it available to others. Not a 
teacher, not a salesperson, not a guru.
