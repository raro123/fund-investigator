## The Core Philosophy

PPFAS Flexi Cap Fund has long been an outlier in the Indian mutual fund industry. Unlike peers who hug the benchmark, this fund follows a distinct value-investing philosophy.

> "We buy businesses, not tickers. Our time horizon is measured in years, not quarters."

### Drawdown Protection

* **2020 Crash:** While the Nifty 50 fell ~38%, PPFAS limited losses to ~29%.
* **2022 Correction:** During the tech sell-off, the fund's international exposure acted as a drag.

## Conclusion

For the patient investor, the data suggests that the fund's strategy of "low churn, high conviction" works.
