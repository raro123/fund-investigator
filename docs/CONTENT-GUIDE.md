# Content Editing Guide

**Remember:** The goal is to be helpful and informative, like a knowledgeable peer who has done the analysis and is making it available to others. The idea is to establish trust and credibility.

**The Persona:** An investigator sharing findings. Not a not a salesperson, not a guru.

## Core Philosophy: Fact-Based Storytelling

We prefer **storytelling based on facts** over fancy claims.
* **The "Fancy Claim" approach:** Tries to create excitement with adjectives ("Incredible growth!").
* **The "Investigator" approach:** Creates engagement by revealing the story inside the data ("The fund stayed flat for 3 years, then suddenly jumped 40% when the benchmark was in bull market").

**Rule:** Let the data provide the drama. Do not manufacture it with hype.

## Checklist for New Content

Before publishing any new content, verify:

- [ ] **Evidence over Adjectives:** Replaced subjective words ("huge", "best") with data ("15% CAGR").
- [ ] **Narrative Flow:** Does the story emerge from the facts, or is it forced by "fancy" language?
- [ ] Avoid exclamation marks.
- [ ] Avoid superlatives ("superior", "revolutionary").
- [ ] Avoid urgency tactics ("now", "don't miss", "limited").
- [ ] Avoid second-person imperatives ("you must", "you should").
- [ ] Explains WHAT & WHY people should care - but in a non-preachy way.
- [ ] Treats reader as intelligent and capable.

## Voice & Tone Reference   

Think of the site as:
- ✅ A colleague sharing useful work
- ✅ A researcher presenting findings
- ✅ A professional offering tools
- ✅ A professional educating by sharing insights

NOT as:
- ❌ A Lecturer talking down to reader
- ❌ A salesperson making a pitch
- ❌ A guru revealing secrets
- ❌ A motivational speaker inspiring action

## "Investigator" Writing Examples (Show, Don't Tell)

| ❌ The "Fancy Claim" Way | ✅ The "Fact-Based Story" Way | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "You must invest in this fund now!" | "The current valuation suggests a potential entry point." | Removes urgency; respects reader agency. |
| "This fund has massive returns." | "The fund outperformed its benchmark by 12%." | Replaces hype with measurable data. |
| "Don't make this mistake!" | "Historical data shows a higher drawdown risk in this sector." | Focuses on evidence, not fear. |
| "We discovered a secret strategy." | "Our analysis indicates a correlation between X and Y." | Professional restraint; implies process, not magic. |

## Report Structure: The Investigation Arc

Every report should follow this logical flow to maintain the storytelling aspect:

1.  **The Premise:** What is the mystery or question? (e.g., "Is HDFC Flexi Cap's volatility justified by its returns?")
2.  **The Evidence:** Present the raw data/charts. (e.g., "Looking at the 5-year rolling returns...")
3.  **The Analysis:** Connect the dots. Use facts to explain the "why." (e.g., "The volatility spiked because of Sector X exposure, but recovery was swift.")
4.  **The Verdict:** A summary of findings, letting the user decide the final action.

## When Unsure

Ask yourself:
1. "Would I say this to a colleague in a professional setting?"
2. "Am I using an adjective where a number would tell a better story?"
3. "Is this information, or is it persuasion in an invasive way?"
If unsure, err on the side of understating rather than overstating.
